                        description: ListMeta describes metadata that synthetic resources
                          must have, including lists and various status objects. A
                          resource may have only one of {ObjectMeta, ListMeta}.

                            description: continue may be set if the user set a limit
                              on the number of items returned, and indicates that
                              the server has more data available. The value is opaque
                              and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint
                              that served this list to retrieve the next set of available
                              objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible
                              if the server configuration has changed or more than
                              a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field
                              returned when using this continue value will be identical
                              to the value in the first response, unless you have
                              received this token from an error message.

                              items in the list which are not included in this list
                              response. If the list request contained label or field
                              selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown
                              and the field will be left unset and omitted during
                              serialization. If the list is complete (either because
                              it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk),
                              then there are no more remaining items and this field
                              will be left unset and omitted during serialization.
                              Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The
                              intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating*
                              the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on
                              the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.

                            data in string form. It is provided as a write-only input
                            field for convenience. All keys and values are merged
                            into the data field on write, overwriting any existing
                            values. The stringData field is never output when reading
                            from the API.

                          the list is complete (either because it is not chunking
                          or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more
                          remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted
                          during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set
                          this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is
                          *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not
                          rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.
