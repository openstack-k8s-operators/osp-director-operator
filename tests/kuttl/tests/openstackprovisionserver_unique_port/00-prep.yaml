# Q: WHAT IS TESTED HERE?
#
# A: 
#
# - Create 1 OpenStackProvisionServer
# - Create another OpenStackProvisionServer with a different port
# - Create a third OpenStackProvisionServer with a duplicate port, which should fail
# - Create 1 OpenStackNet
# - Create 1 OpenStackBaremetalSet with a count of 1, and make sure it succeeds and has a unique port
# - Create another OpenStackBaremetalSet with a count 1, and make sure it succeeds and has a unique port
#
# NOTE: This test assumes you have two (and only two!) extra OCP workers allocated to your cluster as 
#       BaremetalHosts, that are not in-use as actual cluster nodes
#

#
# Attempt to "clear the field" if necessary
