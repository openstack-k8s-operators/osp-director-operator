  # Restart Metal3 pod to reset static provisioning IP that was lost during 00-prep cleanup.
  # Deleting the OsNetConfig and associated NNCPs during prep's cleaning will remove the
  # br-ctlplane bridges, which Metal3 uses as the provisioning interface, and thus removes
  # the 172.22.0.3 static provisioning IP that is needed for DHCP to work.  Now that the
  # OsNetConfig and NNCPs have been restored, restarting the Metal3 pod will ensure that the
  # 172.22.0.3 static IP is re-added to the br-ctlplane on the OCP node on which the Metal3
  # pod lands.
